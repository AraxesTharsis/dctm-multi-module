#Description of how the build system works

= Introduction =

In an ideal world Documentum development would follow the same pattern as mainstream Enterprise Java development practices where tools such as Maven have become popular in standardising and (arguably) simplifying build and deployment processes. [http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html Continuous Integration] has also helped in fostering good build practices.

..but Documentum development has always been different ;-/

This project is an experiment in making Documentum development a bit more mainstream.
